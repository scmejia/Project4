## Phase 1: Queue System
### Process:

For this section of the project, I created a queue system of size 2 with two processes working at once. 


### Result:

### Resources Used:

## Phase 2: Speech To Text
### Process: 

For this section of the project, I used two audio files to test the functionality of the Python script I implemented in order to transcribe the audio in the file to text that would be outputted. 

In the first audio file, I recorded myself saying, "I am from Houston Texas" and in the second file, I said "I enjoy going on runs during the summer". These are the results I expected to be outputted. 

I primarily worked with the SpeechRecognition functionality in Python to get the functions to work.


### Result:
